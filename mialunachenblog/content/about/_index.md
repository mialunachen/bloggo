Hi! I'm Mia Luna Chen, an undergraduate student studying Mechanical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

From FIRST Robotics, to Robosub, to Formula SAE, I have a passion for hands-on mechanical design and fabrication. I'm especially interested in additive manufacturing, from the design and operation of 3D printers, to the characteristics and behaviors of additively manufactured materials.

Outside of engineering, I love to knit, sew, crochet, play piano and violin, and take care of houseplants!

Feel free to reach out to me at mialuna@mit.edu
